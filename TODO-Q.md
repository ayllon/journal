## Questions


## TODO

* Have a look at what SC7 and SC8 are about
* Ask Pierre/Florian about $\sigma$ and depth: does it mean how may sigmas away from the center of the distribution we can see?
  So higher depth => higher sigma because => we "see" better faint objects since they are above the noise? (better focused?)
  Depth also mentioned as magnitude
* Ask them to explain to me too this plot of S8 vs $\omega$
* Template combination Brammer+08
    - TBC that it is worth via EAZY
