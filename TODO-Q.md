## Questions

* What happens with the challenge data?
    * Does it get purged, or archived?
* Challenge is the full thing, or only the bit where everything is put in place and run?
* What's the difference between ST_DataModel and ST-DataModel (and similar distinction based on hyphen vs underscore)
* What is a 2D spectra? (Florian)

## TODO

* Have a look at what SC7 and SC8 are about
* Ask Pierre/Florian about $\sigma$ and depth: does it mean how may sigmas away from the center of the distribution we can see?
  So higher depth => higher sigma because => we "see" better faint objects since they are above the noise? (better focused?)
  Depth also mentioned as magnitude
* Ask them to explain to me too this plot of S8 vs $\omega$
* Template combination Brammer+08
    - TBC that it is worth via EAZY
