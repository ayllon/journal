    * 0.10 to be used in the pipeline (master)
    * 0.12 or 1.0 when GA and EL merged
* Missing true universe to generate the reference catalog (~2 weeks to generate)
    * OU to see how to generate it
    * Calibration pipeline can be used
    * Spec-Z required for calibration sample (for bias)
* Subscribed to sc-pf mailing list
* Phosphoros paper
    * Need to think about the release
    * Missing emission lines (partially tested)
    * Galactic absorption being tested
    * EL should be added to the GUI
        * SP: If not on the GUI, as good as not released
    * Phosphoros is missing provenance information
    * NA: The CLI that generates the plot is not very usable, since you need to know the provenance. Can not be easily adapted to the GUI.
    * How to distribute? Docker better candidate. AA: Copr for Fedora?
