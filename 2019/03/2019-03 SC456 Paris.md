    - 15/09 Main objectives
        * 52929 & 1717 processed in all SDCs with all PFs
        * Large wide field (x38) processed with distribution strategy
    - 15/09 Secondary objectives
    - 15/10 - TK2 (Technical Keypoint 2) ([PHZ TK1 presentation](https://wiki.cosmos.esa.int/euclid/images/d/dc/08-TK1_PHZ_PF_V00.pdf))
    - End of 2019 - Secondary objectives complete & deep execution finished
    
## SIM
* TU common in all bands, and stars and galaxies cut to the same depth VIS < 26
    - [Flagship](https://www.euclid-ec.org/?page_id=4133)
* Real bright stars (pickles instead of besanÃ§on for SC3)
* [Bug #9661](https://euclid.roe.ac.uk/issues/9661): Possible wrong calibration of galaxy fluxes in VIS simulated images
    - Error in magnitude system for stars (AB instead of Vega)
    - Fixed, also for NIS
    - New production running
